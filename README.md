# final-project
Final Project for Drawing on the Web

--------

This final project uses HTML canvas to draw a spirograph-type image onto the canvas.

Javascript random was used in three different elements of this project:
- Creating two circles with random radiuses (within constraints) when the page loads
- Generating randomly colored lines that are drawn to the canvas
- Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (exclusive) to change the angle at which the line for the outer circle rotates

CSS transitions controlled by Javascript were used in the message that instructs the user how to start the program.

The program can be played and paused by hitting any key.
